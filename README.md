- What is Machine Learning?
  Machine learning is a subset of AI where computers learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves training models on data to recognize patterns and make predictions or decisions. It has applications in various fields and is used for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.
- What is Unsupervised vs Supervised learning difference?
  Supervised learning uses labeled data with input-output pairs for training, while unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data and focuses on finding patterns or representations within the data without explicit output labels.
- What is Deep Learning?
  Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves using artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns and representations from data. It allows computers to perform tasks like image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and decision-making at a high level of accuracy and sophistication.
- What is Neural Network (NN)?
  A neural network (NN) is a computational model inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. It consists of interconnected artificial neurons organized into layers. Each neuron receives input, processes it using an activation function, and produces an output. Neural networks are used in deep learning to learn and represent complex patterns and relationships in data.
- What is Convolution Neural Network (CNN)? Please give 2 advantages over NN.
  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are specialized neural networks for image processing. Their advantages over traditional NNs are:
  1. Automatic feature learning: CNNs learn relevant features from data, reducing the need for manual feature engineering.
  2. Spatial invariance: CNNs can detect patterns regardless of their location in the image, making them suitable for tasks like image classification and object detection.
- What is segmentation task in NN? Is it supervised or unsupervised?
  Segmentation task in neural networks involves dividing an image into distinct regions or segments. It can be either supervised (using labeled data) or unsupervised (without explicit labels).
- What is classification task in NN? Is it supervised or unsupervised?
  Classification tasks in neural networks involve categorizing input data into predefined classes or categories. It is a supervised learning task that requires labeled data during training to make predictions on new, unseen data.
- Compare segmentation and classification in NN.
  Segmentation divides an image into segments with pixel-level masks, while classification assigns a single label to an input. Segmentation can be supervised or unsupervised, while classification is typically supervised. Segmentation is used for object detection, while classification is used for tasks like image classification and sentiment analysis.
- What is data and dataset difference?
  In short, "data" refers to individual pieces of information, while a "dataset" is a structured collection of related data points used for analysis or machine learning tasks.
- What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in terms of dataset?
  1. Supervised Learning: Requires a labeled dataset, where each data instance is paired with its corresponding output label.
  2. Unsupervised Learning: Works with an unlabeled dataset, meaning there are no explicit output labels provided for the data instances.

# Data Preprocessing
- What is color space ?
  Color space is a system that defines how colors are represented and organized. It provides a numerical representation of colors for various applications like image processing and graphics.
- What RGB stands for ?
  RGB stands for "Red, Green, Blue," and it is a color model where colors are represented by combining these three primary colors in different intensities.
- In Python, can we transform from one color space to another?
  Yes, in Python, we can transform from one color space to another using various libraries and functions. One popular library for working with colors and color spaces is OpenCV. OpenCV provides functions to convert images 
  between different color spaces, such as RGB to grayscale, RGB to HSV, RGB to LAB, etc.
- What is the popular library for image processing?
  OpenCV is the most popular library for image processing in Python, widely used for various tasks like image manipulation, feature detection, and computer vision due to its efficiency and versatility.
